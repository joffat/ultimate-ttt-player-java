Welcome!
========

Welcome! You're probably here because you're in a hackathon we're running. 

If so, make sure you've read our `Documentation`_.

Once you're ready to write your player, you can find functions that will help you write your player in `API Reference`_

# Compile
From the src folder run `javac -cp . ./Run_Player.java -d ../dist`

# Run
From the dist folder run `uabc --host {server host} --token {your token} -f "java Run_Player"`
